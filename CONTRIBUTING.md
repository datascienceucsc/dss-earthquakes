# Contribution Guidelines

## Code Styling

Be consistent with the official styling guidelines found [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#when-to-use-trailing-commas). This not only vastly improves code readability but also helps avoid merge conflicts and bugs (Python is *very* sensitive to incorrect indentation!).

**tdlr; :**

- Use 4 spaces for indentation (set your tab in VS Code to produces 4 spaces). This is **required** in Python 3.x.
- one statement per line
- avoid useless comments like "Increment X"
- Naming:
  - modules: all-lowercase
  - class: CapWords
  - type variables: CapWords
  - functions and varibles: all-lowecase, words seperated by undescore
  - non-public methoods nad variables: same except use one leading underscore
  - constants: all caps
